# GitHub Search Project

## This project enables individuals to enter an ID in order to find the corresponding GitHub users.

I utilized React and Tailwind CSS to construct this website. It leverages the GitHub REST API to retrieve user data when an ID is entered. The data encompasses various details such as the number of followers, repository information, and more.

## Simple use of this website
